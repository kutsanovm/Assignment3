Assignment 2

The source files I am submitting are:
kutsanovass3.out
GenStack.h
SyntaxCheck.cpp
SyntaxCheck.h
main.cpp
README.md (this read me)

These are in the GitHub repository called “Assignment3”.

Ok so I understood the logic for this one I just needed help from Jacob Anabi to really understand template classes. I also facetimed my pal at Carnegie Mellon and he walked through a checklist for how I'd go about doing this code. I had a lot of issues trying to get my actual SyntaxCheck to work with the GenStack but Corey sat with me for a few hours until it was fixed and he explained what was going wrong (syntax errors adding up and bad implementation of the template class).
